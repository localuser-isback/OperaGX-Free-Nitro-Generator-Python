# OperaGX Free Nitro (Python Version)

[Check out the origional JS Browser version here](https://github.com/localuser-isback/OperaGX-Free-Nitro-Generator)

### How it works?

OperaGX big dumb dumb and you can just keep generating nitro codes from there promotion even after you complete it.

### How do i use the script?

1) Download python 3, almost any version should work.
2) run `pip install requests`
3) Download the main.py file
4) Run `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` which ever works for you.
5) Hit enter
6) Enter the parameters/config
7) wait a bit (depends alot of how many you try to generate, i recommend no more than 200 at a time without a vpn or big wait times)
8) profit!

## ITS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE A VPN, A GOOD FREE ONE IS PROTON.

#### Note: These are PROMO codes not normal nitro codes, this means 1) you cant currently have normal nitro (if you have basic it upgrades) 2) cant have had nitro in x amount of months and 3) requires a credit card (you can cancel imediatly you dont lose the nitro)

#### [Screw it, heres a free 100 codes (by the time your reading this someone has probably claimed them but whatever)](https://github.com/localuser-isback/OperaGX-Free-Nitro-Generator/blob/main/enjoy.txt)
